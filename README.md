<h1 align="center"> üíª dot-Blog  </h1>

### About Project: 

In this project, I integrated React, Node.js, and MySQL to develop a full-stack application. My aim was to build a robust and dynamic blog post app that allows users to create, view, and interact with blog posts.

### Key Highlights:
## Backend Development:
I started by setting up a server using Node.jsand Express. I deployed crucial middleware, defined routes, and implemented controllers to handle requests.

I connected the server to a MySQL database, allowing seamless interactions between the server and the database.

I also ensured secure user authentication by integrating JWT tokens and OAuth 2.0, enabling both third-party sign-ins (Google, GitHub) and custom login processes.

## Database Management:
I created a MySQL database to store blog posts and user information.

I performed CRUD operations, enabling the application to create, read, update, and delete blog posts from the client to the server.

## Frontend Development:
Using React, I built a user-friendly and responsive front-end interface.

I utilized Redux for state management, reducing code complexity by 25% and ensuring consistent data flow across components.

The front-end allows users to easily create and edit blog posts, making the blogging experience smooth and intuitive.

## Security Enhancements:
I implemented bcrypt for password encryption, ensuring data privacy and compliance with security standards.

## Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of how to integrate these technologies to create a fully functional web application. This experience equipped me with the skills needed to build scalable, robust, and efficient web applications.

## Features

- Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the app.
- Authorization: Only authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
- CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- Pagination: Blog posts are paginated to improve app performance.
- Filter: Blog posts can be filtered by topic.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/ludiemert/Full_Stack_App.git`

2. Install dependencies (both `api` and `front`)
   `npm install`

3. `npm start` (both `api` and `front`)

## Notes

You need to create a connection with your on MySQL databae and add data.
